      <h1>What is Stop motion</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Stop Motion is a certain amount of pictures taken creating motion.
        Stop Motion is a way to tell a story and it's giving human quilities to non-living objects.
        There are many different types of Stop Motion and countless ideas for what to do your Stop Motion on.
        Stop Motion is the creating of a movie with non-living objects instead of a movie with people or animals in it.
        If your'e creating a Stop Motion with people or animals, why bother because you can just make a video instead, the point of Stop Motion is to create movies or films with obejects that don't have human aquilities so that you can give them those quilities with the help of Stop Motion, sure you can use a computer animation to do that but computer animations don't look as realistic as if they were actualy animated with Stop Motion. Also you can physically touch any of the objects you are animating compared to computer animation where you can just look at it on the computer. Madagascar is an example of a computer animation and one example of a Stop Motion is The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists</p>
    
        
      <h1>What you need to make a Stop Motion film</h1>
      <br>
      <p>In order to create a Stop Motion you will need some essentials and they are:
        The thing that is in your pocket, a phone, it doesn't have to be a really good phone, it just needs to have a functioning camera, if you are making Stop Motions all the time and your really good at them, then you should probally look at buying eithier a phone with an amazing camera or a really good actual camera, but as a begginer you should just start of with any camera you have whether it being your phone or an actual camera.
        You wil need something to animate with and it could be anything, if you like lego then you can animate with that, if you like clay, you can animate with that, really any non-living object that you like.
        If youre on a phone then you will want to download an app for Stop Motion. The best and most known is called Stop Motion Studio, there is also a paid version but that's for things like sound effects and special effects and there are a few editing platforms out there for free, but if you would prefer to do everything from there, you can just download something called Stop Motion Studio Pro. If you're on a camera then you can just take pictures normally and when you're done animating you can just transfer the file to another device like a computer or phone for editing later on.
        Another thing that you'll need is a desk lamp. You could have three of these desk lamps, one for the left, one for the right and one for the back so that you're scene is fully light, but you may only need one depending on how big or small your scene is.
        You'll need a sturdy desk to animate on so that there is no unwanted change of movement in your Stop Motion films, if you don't have a sturdy desk then it's ok because there si many ways of resolving this for example putting tissue under the shorter leg.
        You'll need an editing platform, editing is a very important part of any movie and it's also important for Stop Motion, unless you have something like Stop Motion Studio Pro although I prefer adding in my own soun effects from editing platforms or making my own but you may not.
        The last thing that you'll need is some sort of stand whether it being a bought one or one you make yourself, even if you make it out of lego bricks, a place to hold your phone still in one place while animating.</p>

      <h1>The basics of Stop Motion</h1>
      <br> 
      <p> When you're creating a Stop Motion there are some simple tips that can help make them look smoother, more realistic and some other useful information that could help with a better outcome for your Stop Motion film. For the first tip Let's say you're making a fight scene between two figures you built you'll want to add in something called camera movement when animating, this will help with the realism of the film simple stuff like that can really help with you're Stop Motions. This doesn't only help with Lego motions or just fight scenes, there are many other ways you can use camera movement to produce a better outcome for you're Stop Motions, but you can try that yourself with one of you're Stop Motions, on what Stop Motion films camera movement can help with you're Stop Motions.
        
        For the second tip, this is essential to all stop motions. It is very very very imporatant. It's called ease in and ease out. This is when you're starting off animiating whatever you're animating slow and moving whatever you're animating a little more each time unti you get to the middle where you move whatever you're animating alot and then once you're getting to the end of your movement you do small movements again and that's ease in and ease out, creating a Stop Motion without ease in and ease out compared to a Stop Motion with ease in and ease out is huge you'll see a massive improvemoent in the smoothness of your're Stop Motions when using ease in and ease out.</p>
    

      

      <h1>Tips for Stop Motion.</h1>
     <br>
     <p>This is one of the first things you should do when preparing for a Stop Motion. You should stick down the platform that you're creating you're Stop Motion on so that it doesn't move when you're trying to animate. These big or small movements can affect your your Stop Motions hugely and it's hard to move it back into the exact spot you had it in before, so you can use anything like tape or sticky dough to stick down what you're animating on.
        Any natural light, other sources of light that's not from your desk lamp, your shadow that's showing on your set or a fan that's switched on constantly turning around should be blocked out, like if there's natural light coming in to your room then you should close your curtains, if there's any other light other then your desk lamps shining onto your set then you should turn off those lights, if your fan's on, then it should be switched off and if your shadows are in the way of your set then you should move out of the way becase if these things arn't done then it could cause something called "light flicker" in your Stop Motions which is in the name "light""flicker"
        Your set. Now when I say your set I mean your build. For example is your build a house, a police station, a city. Even if you don't have a build, if your just creating your Stop Motion on a plain lego base plate or a pile of clay, that's still what im talking about. Now you're base you may not be a good builder and is way your just doing it on something like a plain base plate and that's fine, in stop motion you don't have to be a good builder to have a good Stop Motion but builds are going to give much more deail to your viewers and much more people are going to be intrested in your films, for example if your remaking the transformers movie you'll want to build some of the transformers or a real place in that movie. That's stuff that the viewers will be intrested in like "oh i've seen that in the transformers movie" and they'll get intrested because they may have seen that movie before. Even if your Stop Motion film isn't from a movie your personal builds will add lots more detail to your Stop Motion films. You may be good at building already or you may not be, if you think you need a little bit of help with building, I can give you three tips, Practise building, watch youtube videos and design before you build, see even if you're really good at building you'll still make mistakes and I find that if you design something first whether it being a software on your computer or you drawing it you'll have what what it's supposed to look like right infront of you so designing is a useful tool for creating build for you're Stop Motions, if you want to design your build by drawing it out and you don't think you're good enough at drawing, you don't need to be, it's not art but a plan for you to build something for your Stop Motion.
        Writing a script for your Stop Motions is something important to do before you make you're Stop Motion something out is very important when it comes to Stop Motion and any movie, you won't need to think of anything to add to you're Stop Motions if you have a script because that's all what you'll be putting into your Stop Motion, although you may have some better ideas that come along as you animate and you can adjust but the script is the main idea of what your Stop Motion is going to be about, scripts help you not forget anything that you want to add to your Stop Motion.
        This is a short tip. When animating, make sure to not bump your desk and tap your phone to hard because this can cause unwanted change of movement in your Stop Motions. You'll also want to stick down your phone stand with anything that sticks whether it being tape or a sticky dough so your stand doesn't move or slide around when your trying to animate.
        Side note: When you're editing your Stop Motion films, you can edit any way you want. Editing is important but whatever you've added to your Stop Motion film is going to be related to the things you add when you're editing, for example if you made a racing Stop Motion you'll want to put in car sounds so you get the idea, editing is different for everyone depending on the Stop Motion film you make and it can really be done any way you like.</p>

      <h1>How to think of ideas for Stop Motion</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Now, when you're trying to get an idea for your next Stop Motion, firstly think what cstegory your movies going to be in and then you think what you want to add to it, lets say I want to make an action film, then since it's an action film, I think oh maybe I should add some fast past gun fights and then you add other stuff from there so it's very important to have an idea. Secondly once you have thought of your idea then there are a few factors to consider, lile fps, lighting and etc., if you are making an action film then you might want the film to be more fast, like at 15 or 24 fps and if you are creating a film that has not much energy and movemnet in it or if it is very peacful then you may want to consider and fps ranging from around 8-12 fps.</p>
      <p>I really really do not recemend an fps lower than 8 because you might get a very very slow and unrealistic movement.</p>
      

      <h1>Camera angles</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Camera angles are very important in Stop Motion, I advise you to move your camera angles every 30 seconds within your film, also camera movement, when you move your camera you feel like your in the action and it's more of a realistic effect, now back to camera angles, if you are moving your camera often enought, you will get a different asspect of the film, and see more of the charcter/characters but also remember that you shouldn't move your camera angle constantly because then you or your viewers won't be able to proccess what's happening in the film, so just try keep that in mind when you are animating.</p>
