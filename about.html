               <h1>This is me</h1>
              <p>hello everyone, im a Stop Motion animater, I love to create fast past lego Stop Motion short films with lots of action, like explosions, gunshots and fast cars, in lego Stop Motion in my spare time.
               I can often search or watch videos on certain aspects in Stop Motion as I am a beginner too, no I haven't started animating yesterday and I don't make Stop Motion's often.
               but I know alot about it. I am always improving and always learning new things. My best advice for you is to keep creating them each day, personally I think that you should start creating short Stop Motion films, Im going to be creating short
               short Stop Motion films for as long as I do Stop Motion since Stop Motions take long and I feel creating short films are more worth it for me, because I feel like I rush when im creating a long film, although it's really all up tp you, the one thing you should keep
               in mind when your creating a Stop Motion is it can be anything you want it to be, whatever it is, it will be awesome, I think you should also consider how long the film is and that way you can try see how long you are going to be animating a day, unless it's short like a minute, you could then do that in a day.
               Im constantly thinking about my next Stop Motion and trying to improve from the last time, one more thing, this has helped me alot lately and it is taking advice from people, now I always think you should show people youre lovely Stop Motions so they can give you feed back, I was told by one or two people that my Stop Motions were two quick and it was too hard to proccess what was happening.
               So I thought it was the fps at first, but it wasn' t and I was confused by that and I know now that I didn't firstly use ease in and ease out and I was creating a few pictures in a movemnet, so just keep that in mind for your Stop Motions, also take advice from people becuase it really helps you to improve, but as a beginner don't worry to much, just create a few Stop Motions first and see where you are and what you need to do and improve.
               I hope this website has given you a really basic guide on how to create you're very own Stop Motions, , I hope all your Stop Motion go well and good luck, I need to get right bacck to animating so see ya.</p>
